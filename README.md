## Explanation of Design Choices

### HTML Structure

- **Semantic Tags:** Utilized semantic HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Navigation:** Implemented the navigation menu as an unordered list inside the `<nav>` element, providing clear and accessible links to different sections of the website.
- **Forms:** Used `<label>` and `<input>` elements in the contact form to ensure accessibility, allowing screen readers to correctly interpret the form fields.
- **Image Gallery:** Created the gallery section using a `<div>` container with images inside, styled to be responsive and interactive.

### CSS Styling

- **Font Choice:** Selected the monospace font family for a clean, simple look that enhances readability.
- **Color Scheme:** The color scheme consists of background colors like `whitesmoke`, `tan`, and `black`, with text colors such as `dimgray` and `white`. Highlight colors include `darkorange` and `dodgerblue` to draw attention to headings and buttons.
- **Layout:** Utilized Flexbox for the layout to ensure the content is flexible and responsive. This is evident in the gallery section where images are laid out in a flexible grid.
- **Hover Effects:** Applied hover effects to buttons and images to enhance interactivity. For example, the button background changes color on hover, and images in the gallery slightly scale up.

## Reflection on Implementation Process

### Why I Coded the Website the Way I Did

- **Accessibility:** Ensuring the website is accessible to all users, including those using screen readers, guided the use of semantic HTML and proper labeling of form elements.
- **Responsiveness:** Aimed for the website to be accessible and visually appealing on various devices, so Flexbox was used for a responsive layout and relative units like percentages for width and padding.
- **User Experience:** Interactive elements like hover effects on buttons and images improve the user experience, making the website more engaging.
