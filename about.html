        <h3>About My Hobby</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the "About Us" section of My Hobby Website. This page is
          dedicated to sharing the passion and journey behind my love for
          tennis.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          The journey started when I was just 4 years old. My dad would take my
          siblings and me to the court on Saturdays to hit with a coach. This
          early introduction sparked a lifelong love for the sport. Watching
          tennis matches on TV, especially major tournaments, became a cherished
          pastime.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I grew older, my passion for tennis only intensified. I began
          participating in local tournaments, where I honed my skills and gained
          valuable experience. The thrill of competing, the satisfaction of a
          well-placed shot, and the camaraderie with fellow players were all
          elements that fueled my desire to improve. My weekends soon filled
          with practice sessions and matches, each one a step towards becoming a
          better player.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the highlights of my tennis journey is attending the Rogers Cup
          in Toronto. This prestigious tournament attracts the top tennis
          players from around the world, offering a unique opportunity to
          witness high-level competition up close. Watching my idols play live
          is an incredible experience that motivates me to push my limits on the
          court. Whether it's Federer’s graceful backhand, Nadal’s relentless
          energy, or Serena’s powerful serves, seeing these legends in action
          inspires me to strive for greatness in my own game. Additionally, the
          Rogers Cup provides a chance to engage with the tennis community, meet
          other enthusiasts, and deepen my appreciation for the sport
        </p>

        <h3>My Favorite Tennis Players</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rafael Nadal</li>
          <li>Carlos Alcaraz</li>
          <li>Jannik Sinner</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Tennis?</h3>
        <p>
          Tennis is more than just a sport; it’s a way to challenge oneself,
          stay fit, and connect with others. The discipline and dedication
          required in tennis are life lessons that go beyond the court.
